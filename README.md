# GTAVFrontendMenu

The GTA V Pause Menu recreated using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with some basic plugins).

Base resolution is 1920Ã—1080. Auto-scales for bigger resolutions, but for smaller resolutions it's buggy (yet).

Demo available here: https://tomilovsenya.github.io/GTAVFrontendMenu/main_menu.html

## Current Functionality
* Tabs scroll: Press Q/E, click Left/Right arrows or a tab itself. The scroll is animated just as in the original game
* Categories scroll: Press W/S or Up/Down arrow, or a category itself
* Less tabs mode: If there are less than 6 tabs specified, they are auto-sized to fill the navbar; if there's only one, it hides the scroll arrows

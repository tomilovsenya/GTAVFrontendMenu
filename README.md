# GTAVFrontendMenu

The ```GTA V Pause Menu``` recreated using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with some basic plugins).

Base resolution is 1920×1080. Auto-scales for bigger resolutions, but for smaller resolutions it's buggy (yet).

Demo available here: https://tomilovsenya.github.io/GTAVFrontendMenu/main_menu.html
